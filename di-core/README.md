# di-core

Typeful hierarchical structured logging without monad towers.

If you like monad towers, though, check out
[di-monad](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/di-monad).

Also, for a logging library, this one doesn't do any rendering of log messages.
Please refer to [di-handle](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/di-handle)
and [di-df1](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/di-df1) for that.
